Hi, I’m Bede Ffinian Rowe Davies

I'm a Marine Ecologist with an interest in big data assessents of marine environments and how anthropogenic impacts effect those environments.

I recently handed in my PhD thesis assessing the effects of a whole-site partial Marine Protected Area and its uses for Ecosystem Based Management

I’m looking to collaborate on all work assessing anthropogenic impacts to ecosystems (mostly marine but also assess terrestrial ecosystems)
